7-9. No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times . Add code near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders . Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches .
