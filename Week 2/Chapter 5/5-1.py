'''
5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests . Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test .
Your code should look something like this:
                  car = 'subaru'
                  print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
                  print(car == 'subaru')
                  print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
                  print(car == 'audi')
• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False .
• Create at least 10 tests . Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False .

a = 5
b = 7

print('is a equal to b? I predict False')
print(a == b)
print('is a equal to b? I predict True')
print(a <= b)
print('is a equal to b? I predict Fase')
print(a >= b)
print('is the modulus of a to b equal to 1? I predict False')
print(a % b == 1)
